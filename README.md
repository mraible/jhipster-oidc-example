# Use OpenID Connect Support with JHipster

See [Use OpenID Connect Support with JHipster](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/10/20/oidc-with-jhipster) to see how this application was created. You can also [watch a screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaqIsQB1yeQ).

This application was generated using JHipster 4.14.3, you can find documentation and help at [http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.3](http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.14.3).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use yarn scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.


Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    yarn start

[Yarn][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `yarn update` and `yarn install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `yarn help update`.

The `yarn run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

## OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Congratulations! You've selected an excellent way to secure your JHipster application. If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see [What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth)

To log in to your app, you'll need to have [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) up and running. The JHipster Team has created a Docker container for you that has the default users and roles. Start Keycloak using the following command.

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up
```

The security settings in `src/main/resources/application.yml` are configured for this image.

```yaml
security:
    basic:
        enabled: false
    oauth2:
        client:
            accessTokenUri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/token
            userAuthorizationUri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/auth
            clientId: web_app
            clientSecret: web_app
            clientAuthenticationScheme: form
            scope: openid profile email
        resource:
            userInfoUri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
            tokenInfoUri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
            preferTokenInfo: false
```

### Okta

If you'd like to use Okta instead of Keycloak, you'll need to change a few things. First, you'll need to create a free developer account at <https://developer.okta.com/signup/>. After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, that has a name like `https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com`.

Modify `src/main/resources/application.yml` to use your Okta settings.

```yaml
security:
    basic:
        enabled: false
    oauth2:
        client:
            accessTokenUri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/token
            userAuthorizationUri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize
            clientId: {clientId}
            clientSecret: {clientSecret}
            clientAuthenticationScheme: form
            scope: openid profile email
        resource:
            userInfoUri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo
            tokenInfoUri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/introspect
            preferTokenInfo: false
```

Create an OIDC App in Okta to get a `{clientId}` and `{clientSecret}`. To do this, log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click the **Next** button. Give the app a name youâ€™ll remember, specify `http://localhost:8080` as a Base URI, and `http://localhost:8080/login` as a Login Redirect URI. Click **Done** and copy the client ID and secret into your `application.yml` file.

> **TIP:** If you want to use the [Ionic Module for JHipster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-jhipster-ionic), you'll need to add `http://localhost:8100` as a **Login redirect URI** as well.

Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group and add users into them. Create a user (e.g., "admin@jhipster.org" with password "Java is hip in 2017!"). Modify e2e tests to use this account when running integration tests. You'll need to change credentials in `src/test/javascript/e2e/account/account.spec.ts` and `src/test/javascript/e2e/admin/administration.spec.ts`.

Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, click the **Authorization Servers** tab and edit the default one. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it "groups" or "roles", and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to "Groups" and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

After making these changes, you should be good to go! If you have any issues, please post them to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jhipster). Make sure to tag your question with "jhipster" and "okta".

### Service workers

Service workers are commented by default, to enable them please uncomment the following code.

* The service worker registering script in index.html

```html
<script>
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./sw.js')
        .then(function() { console.log('Service Worker Registered'); });
    }
</script>
```

Note: workbox creates the respective service worker and dynamically generate the `sw.js`

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    yarn add --exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    yarn add --dev --exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css](src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css) file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~
Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts


## Building for production

To optimize the oidc application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    yarn test

UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [src/test/javascript/e2e](src/test/javascript/e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`./mvnw spring-boot:run`) and running the tests (`yarn run e2e`) in a second one.

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw verify -Pprod dockerfile:build

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
